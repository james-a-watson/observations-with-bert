This Project is split into 3 main notebooks designed to section off the different functionality:

1. model_train.ipynb - this is the initial build of the model where you will go from raw data and base model to a cleaned dataset and a fine-tuned model.
2. warm_start.ipynb - Build on the model created by model_train and further fine-tunes by exposing it to more data.
3. preditions.ipynb - Take a dataset of text inputs and predicts the category

To effectively utilise these notebook, work through the steps above keeping track of the most recent model and specifiying the path to that in the next notebook.
